# FaceRecognitionProject


2 face recognition projects that can identify, count and track faces using cascade from OpenCV

- Image Identity Recognition Program - 
This program can identify faces of people given the names of the person and a random image that the person could possibly be in. It is also able to count the amout of people in the image. If the program can't identify someone it will mark them as unknown. You can also change how closely you want to the matches to be when comparing faces. 

- Video Identity Recognition Program - 
The second project is similar to the first project but we use the webcam from the computer to track your face and identify the person in the video, and mark it with your name.
